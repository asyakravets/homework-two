Outside the cafe by the cracker factory\
You were practicing a magic trick\
And my thoughts got rude, as you talked and chewed\
On the last of your pick and mix

Said, "You're mistaken if you're thinking that I haven't been called "cold" before"
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
Is all you had left and it was going to wasteYour pastimes, consisted of the strange

And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called
"Crying Lightning"
And how you like to aggravate the ice-cream man on rainy afternoons
